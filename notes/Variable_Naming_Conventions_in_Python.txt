Variable Naming Conventions in Python

1: A variable name can contain only letters, numbers and understores
2: Variable name can start with letters and understores but not with numbers
3: Spaces are not allowed instead we can use _[understores]

4: It should be short and descriptive[e.g. t_n x, teacher_name âœ”]

5: Variable is case-sensitve.

Camel Case Conventions -- second and subsequent words are always Capitalized, e.g. studentName

Pascal Case Conventions -- same as Camel but first also Capitalized e.g. StudentName

Snake Case Conventions -- words are followed by understores, e.g. student_name
